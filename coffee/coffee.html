            <h1>Black coffee</h1>
            <p>Black coffee has no milk or cream added to it. Black coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.</p>

            <h1>Espresso</h1>
            <p>Espresso is the name of a highly concentrated, bittersweet coffee originating in Italy in the early 20th century. Translated from Italian, the word espresso refers to the speed and single-serve nature of the coffee compared with slower and more communal methods of brewing coffee. Each shot of espresso is made to order upon customer request, as opposed to being brewed in anticipation of demand. Typically served in a demitasse cup or used with other ingredients to create another beverage such as a cappuccino or a caffè corretto, espresso has become representative of coffee culture in many coffee-consuming regions.</p>

            <h1>Cappuccino</h1>
            <p>A cappuccino is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and milk. It consists of one-third espresso, one-third heated milk and one-third milk foam and is generally served in a 6 to 8-ounce cup. The cappuccino is considered one of the original espresso drinks representative of Italian espresso cuisine and eventually Italian-American espresso cuisine.</p>
            <p>Cappuccino is one of the few original espresso drinks that can be found across all major espresso cultures. The cappuccino began in Italian cafés and migrated to Italian-American menus before taking hold in American coffee houses. Today, the cappuccino remains a fixture in modern espresso culture.</p>

            <h1>Caffè Latte</h1>
            <p>Caffè latte is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and steamed milk. It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. Depending on the skill of the barista, the foam can be poured in such a way to create a picture. Common pictures that appear in lattes are love hearts and ferns. Latte art is an interesting topic in itself.</p>
            <p>Traditionally the cafe latte is a ratio of two parts coffee and one part steamed milk (also called a Café Au Lait).</p>

            <h1>Caffè Mocha</h1>
            <p>Like a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk, but with added chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder, although many varieties use chocolate syrup. Mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate.</p>

            <p>Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of) espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration.</p>
            <p>
              A variant is white caffè mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk or dark. There are also variants of the drink that mix the two syrups; this mixture is referred to by several names, including black and white mocha, marble mocha, tan mocha, tuxedo mocha, and zebra</p>
