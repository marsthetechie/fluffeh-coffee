    <h1>About us!</h1>
    <p>We are a team of very ambitious coffee lovers. We know what it's like to be in a constant hurry and being busy and how at least one cup of coffee can change your whole day.
    We found ourselves on the go very often and there was little or no time to prepare our own coffee, and we desperately needed it. One day, the most brilliant one of us said "Hey guys, why don't you open a coffee shop? It would solve most of your "no coffee" problems, and can help others too."
    We were like "Naaaah".
    Well... That night we could't sleep. We were too occupied thinking about a potential "coffee shop solution" that was presented to us.
    In that moment I thought that if there is something we love and need everyday, well, that's deffinately coffee.
      Seems my partner had the same thing on his mind.</p>
    <p>Se, here we are.</p>
    <p>Our coffe can bring you joy and happy feelings, as well as energy for having a great day. With a sip of our coffee, everything seems possible.</p>
    <p>But why limit yourself to just one cup?</p>
    <p>See you in our shop!</p>
