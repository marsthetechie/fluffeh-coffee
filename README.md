# Fluffeh coffee

The "Fluffeh coffee" is my imaginary coffee shop and this would be its website.
This coffee shop is actually a place where you can get some coffee to go. 
On this website you can see all the coffee we are offering, some information about us (coffee makers!), locations where you can find us (not for real of course), and ways to contact and suggest some new coffee flavor or the way of making it.

## Preview

When you download or clone this project for preview, the map on the locations page will not work unless you put your API key in locations.html on line 68. Just replace `YOURAPIKEY` with your API key.
